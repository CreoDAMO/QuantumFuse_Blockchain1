## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or declined, etc.

1. **Where to report**:
    - Report vulnerabilities by emailing jacquedegraff@creodamo.com.
    - Alternatively, submit issues to our [GitHub repository's security advisories](https://github.com/yourproject/security/advisories).

2. **Acknowledgment**:
    - You will receive an acknowledgment of your report within 24 hours.
    - We aim to provide a status update every 5 days until the vulnerability is resolved or otherwise addressed.

3. **Evaluation Process**:
    - Reports will be evaluated by our security team within 48 hours of acknowledgment.
    - If a vulnerability is confirmed, we will provide a timeline for a fix.

4. **Expectations**:
    - If a report is accepted, the vulnerability will be patched and a new release issued.
    - If a report is declined, you will receive an explanation.

5. **Confidentiality**:
    - We request that vulnerability reports are kept confidential until a fix is released.
    - We will credit reporters in our security advisories unless they wish to remain anonymous.
