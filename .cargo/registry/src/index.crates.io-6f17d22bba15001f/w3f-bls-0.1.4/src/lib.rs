//! # Aggregate BLS signature library with extensive tuning options.
//!
//! In short, anyone using BLS signatures should normally choose both
//! an orientation as well as some aggregation and batching strategies
//! These two decissions impact performance dramaticaly, but making
//! the optimal choises requires some attentiom.  This crate employs
//! convenient abstraction boundaries between curver arithmatic,
//! verifier routines, and aggregated and/or batched BLS signatures.
//!
//! ### Pairings
//!
//! If we have two elliptic curve with a pairing `e`, then
//! a BLS signature `sigma = s*H(msg)` by a public key `S = s g1`
//! can be verified with the one equation `e(g1,sigma) = e(S,H(msg))`.
//! These simple BLS signatures are very slow to verify however
//! because the pairing map `e` is far slower than many cryptographic
//! primitives.
//!
//! Our pairing `e` maps from a small curve over `F(q)` and a larger
//! curve over `F(q^2)` into some multipliccative group if a field,
//! normally over `F(q^12)`.  In principle, this map `e` into `F(q^12)`
//! makes pairing based cryptography like BLS less secure than
//! other elliptic curve based cryptography, which further slows down
//! BLS signatures by requiring larger `q`.
//!
//! ### Arithmatic
//!
//! An almost universally applicable otimization is to seperate the
//! "Miller loop" that computes in `F(q)` and `F(q^2)` from the slow
//! final exponentiation that happens in `F(q^12)`.  So our actual
//! verification equation more resembles `e(-g1,sigma) e(S,H(msg)) = 1`.
//!
//! As one curve is smaller and hence faster, the user should choose
//! which orientation of curves they prefer, meaning to which curve
//! they hash, and which curves hold the signatues and public keys.
//! In other words, your desired aggregation techniques and usage
//! characteristics should determine if youp refer the verification
//! equation `e(g1,sigma) = e(S,H(msg))` or the fliped form
//! `e(sigma,g2) = e(H(msg),S)`.  See `UsualBLS` and `TinyBLS`.
//!
//! ### Aggregation
//!
//! We consder BLS signatures interesting because they support
//! dramatic optimizations when handling multiple signatures together.
//! In fact, BLS signatures support aggregation by a third party
//! that makes signatures smaller, not merely batch verification.  
//! All this stems from the bilinearity of `e`, meaning we reduce
//! the number of pairings, or size of the miller loop, by appling
//! rules like `e(x,z)e(y,z) = e(x+y,z)`, `e(x,y)e(x,z) = e(x,y+z)`,
//! etc.
//!
//! In essence, our aggregation tricks fall into two categories,
//! linear aggregation, in which only addition is used, and
//! delinearized optimiztions, in which we multiply curve points
//! by values unforseeable to the signers.
//! In general, linear techniques provide much better performance,
//! but require stronger invariants be maintained by the caller,
//! like messages being distinct, or limited signer sets with
//! proofs-of-possession.  Also, the delinearized techniques remain
//! secure without tricky assumptions, but require more computation.
//!
//! ### Verification
//!
//! We can often further reduce the pairings required in the
//! verification equation, beyond the naieve information tracked
//! by the aggregated signature itself.  Aggregated signature must
//! state all the individual messages and/or public keys, but
//! verifiers may collapse anything permitted.
//! We thus encounter aggregation-like decissions that impact
//! verifier performance.
//!
//! We therefore provide an abstract interface that permits
//! doing further aggregation and/or passing any aggregate signature
//! to any verification routine.
//!
//! As a rule, we also attempt to batch normalize different arithmatic
//! outputs, but concievably small signer set sizes might make this
//! a pessimization.
//!
