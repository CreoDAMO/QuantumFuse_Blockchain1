[dependencies]
# io-lifetimes only depends on libc/windows-sys for the ability to close
# and duplicate fds/handles/sockets. The following are just optional
# dependencies to add foreign-type impls for the traits. In the future,
# we'll prefer to have crates provide their own impls; this is just a
# temporary measure.

# Optionally depend on fs_err to implement traits for its types for now.
fs-err = { version = "2.6.0", optional = true }

[target.'cfg(not(target_os = "wasi"))'.dependencies]
# Optionally depend on os_pipe to implement traits for its types for now.
os_pipe = { version = "1.0.0", features = ["io_safety"], optional = true }

# The following dependencies allow io-lifetimes to define impls for various
# third-party traits. This is only done in not(io_safety_is_in_std) mode,
# because when we're using the std types and traits, we can't define impls
# on third-party traits, due to the orphan rule. Work is ongoing to add
# the needs impls upstream.
#
# These dependencies are currently disabled on WASI, because we need to
# enable some features which don't work on WASI yet. So for now, WASI users
# will need to wait until the impls are added upstream.

# Optionally depend on async-std just to provide impls for its types.
async-std = { version = "1.12.0", optional = true }
# Optionally depend on tokio to implement traits for its types.
tokio = { version = "1.6.0", features = ["io-std", "fs", "net", "process"], optional = true }
# Optionally depend on socket2 to implement traits for its types. This uses
# 0.4 because 0.5 has an MSRV of 1.63, which is the version where io-lifetimes
# switches to using the types and traits from std ("io_safety_is_in_std"),
# and disables the third-party impls.

# Optionally depend on mio to implement traits for its types.
